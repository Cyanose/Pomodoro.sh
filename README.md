simple bash pomodoro timer

## Usage

run the script with the `-s` or `-l` parameter depending on whether you want a 25 or 50 minute session. The next parameter this script accepts is "refresh time" in seconds. The short session is followed by 5 minute break, and the long session is followed by 10 minutes one.
